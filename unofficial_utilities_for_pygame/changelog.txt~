 - Added a "name" option for background color presets
     - Added a new preset that uses the colour named 'background'
 - Background Presets are stored in the Game class
     - They are still (temporarily) accessible through the old method
 - color in draw_text renamed to color_id
     - This now uses a name from your colors, but can still use a hex code/list
 - in fonts.txt and colors/colours.txt, any lines starting with '#', as well as blank lines, are ignored.
